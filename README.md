# Covid_19_topic_modeling
## Project on COVID-19 dataset

Just a few months ago, 2020 was believed to be as normal of a year as any other year. But then, COVID-19 happened, and it has been disrupting life in an unbelievable way. There has been so much news about COVID-19, but not all of them are reliable. In order to really understand the virus and different risk factors, it’s important to read and use scientific facts.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 52,000 scholarly articles, including over 41,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses.

With 52,000 articles available, it would be very challenging for someone who only wants to explore a particular topic to have to browse through all articles and find relevant documents. Therefore, in this kernel, I would like to implement an engine that allows viewers to explore different information related to COVID-19 based on the viewer’s topics of interest. These topics can range from: what do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?, what do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?, to what do we know about diagnostics and surveillance?, and so on.
